### Summary
1. A transformation-based approach obtains competitive performance to corpus-based techniques.
2. Easily portable (and readable)
3. 


### The Approach

1. Annotated text is passed through an initial-state annotator and can vary in complexity (i.e., output of an n-gram tagger, you can apply pos taggers in a cascading fashion!).
2. The initial state



Part-of-speech taggers in cascading fashion
