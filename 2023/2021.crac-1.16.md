### Introduction
Coreference resolution (e.g. Jack and he in Jack remembered he had an appointment) is well known to be a difficult task in natural language processing, employing necessary scoring functions and token representation to avoid pronoun misclassification. Despite improved performance, few work examining the mention detection-linker interaction has been extended to current neural architecture. The best instantiations of this model, SpanBERT and c2f-coref, are used to investigate its two tasks: mention detection and mention linker.
