### Abridged Summary
This paper provides a few useful things to know about machine learning—ha ha! Machine Learning can be defined as the task of finding patterns in the training examples and inferring a function that represents the data. **A hypothesis is an approximation of the target function f : x -> f(x).** There can be multiple such functions, meaning a collection of hypothesis.

The author summarized the three components of machine learning algorithms as: 
> *LEARNING = REPRESENTATION + EVALUATION + OPTIMIZATION*.

Representation — A classifier must be represented by a formal language for a computer to handle. **Choosing a representation for a learner is tantamount to choosing the set of classifiers it can possibly learn.** We can formalize the idea of concept learning by referring to this set as the hypothesis space of the learner. This problem is defined as search the pre-defined space for the hypothesis that best fits the training examples.

The **hypothesis space** is the set of possible approximations that an algorithm can create for f to minimize loss. Machine Learning is a device that explores this hypothesis space. For example, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression have an infinite hypothesis space of (parameterized) functions.

> **_H_** = {h<sub>1</sub>, h<sub>2</sub>, ..., h<sub>*n*</sub>}

That is to say if a model is not in the hypothesis space, it simply cannot be learned. Here we have the choice (i.e., choosing the representation) whether to restrict our hypothesis space or extend our hypothesis space to more complex algorithms. Remember, we do not want "Logistic Regression" in the abstract sense but rather the model that comes from training the algorithm on a set of training examples.
